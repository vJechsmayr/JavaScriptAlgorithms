# The Algorithms - JavaScript

## All algorithms implemented in JavaScript (for education)

There implementations are for learning purposes. If you want to contribute more efficient solutions feel free to open an issue and commit your solution.

## Inspiration

You can look for Algorithms to implement at: [LeetCode Algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)

To contribute make sure the Algorithm isn't commited yet! Make sure to add the number of the Issue in your PR.

## Algorithm guides

- To create a solution for an algorithm, create a folder with the name of your solution in camelCase, and create a your solution file in the folder.
- To verify your algorithm it will be good create a well written test case, [jest](https://jestjs.io/) has already been implemented and you can start writing your test cases.

Example:
To solve for palindrome algorithm you should

- [x] Create a folder with the name of your solution `palindrome`
- [x] Create a file in your folder with name of your solution `palindrome.js`
- [x] Create a test file with name of your solution and write your test cases `palindrome.test.js`
